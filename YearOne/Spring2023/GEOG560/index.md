# Huh? Wait, what?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my friends, you see correctly! There isn't anything "real" to read on here as my final project, so much as this *is* the final project for the class! I initially had another [GitHub page](https://FM-Kim.github.io) but one thought led to another for another project, so here we are now. If you have any feedback or notice anything dodgy, let me know!
