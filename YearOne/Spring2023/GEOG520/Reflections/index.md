<h2 id="Beginnings"</h2>

    In the beginning, long before now, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer. I started learning how to swim as a toddler and grew confident as a child...and damn did I love the water. At the time, that's all that mattered. I didn't know that the marine life I would see performing in SeaWorld advertisements were being mistreated, nor did I know that there were entire tourism economies that thrived on the backs of local people living near the temperate waters of the Equator and on the fins of dolphins and rays that lived beside them. It seems like children find most everything alluring. Yet, I hesitate to conclude the thought there, as I'm reminded of countless class discussions where we also pointed to the child labor that enables and provides for our lifestyles; to the child soldiers who are taken and enlisted to fight for others' freedoms; to the other end of the spectrum where children are orphaned from war. I wonder about what parts of life *are* alluring to children in these circumstances. Is it the Western Capitalist society that is glamorized? The Asian capitalist societies who are rising in power? Is it the material parts of life?
