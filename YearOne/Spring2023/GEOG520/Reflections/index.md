## Beginnings
In the beginning, long before now, I wanted to be a dolphin trainer. I started learning how to swim as a toddler and grew confident as a child...and damn did I love the water. At the time, that's all that mattered. I didn't know that the marine life I would see performing in SeaWorld advertisements were being mistreated, nor did I know that there were entire tourism economies that thrived on the backs of local people living near the temperate waters of the Equator and on the fins of dolphins and rays that lived beside them. It seems like children find most everything alluring. Yet, I hesitate to conclude the thought there, as I'm reminded of countless class discussions where we also pointed to the child labor that enables and provides for our lifestyles; to the child soldiers who are taken and enlisted to fight for others' freedoms; to the other end of the spectrum where children are orphaned from war. I wonder about what parts of life *are* alluring to children in these circumstances. Is it the Western Capitalist society that is glamorized? The Asian capitalist societies who are rising in power? Is it the material or immaterial?

For young Namjoon Kim (김남준) and Yoongi Min (민윤기), it was music. In the 30 years that followed the Korean War, South Korea saw a period of economic growth – turbulent, but positive nonetheless. However, this was happening concurrently with overwhelming political instability during which time corporate conglomerates (chaebol/jaebol, 재벌) were established (e.g., Hyundai, LG, Samsung). It was due to these nepotistic and otherwise corrupt business practices coupled with little regulation from the financial sector that the country faced a financial crisis in the late 1990’s and required a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The conditions of the bailout were strict and required the Korean banks to increase interest rates in a way that caused already precarious citizens to become even more at risk. It is under these conditions that Namjoon and Yoongi were raised and with this backdrop that they looked to music and performing as a means of surviving.
